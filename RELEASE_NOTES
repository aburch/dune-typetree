TypeTree
========

This is the 2.3.0-rc1 release of the TypeTree library for statically typed object trees.

TypeTree 2.3 is compatible with the 2.3 release of the DUNE core modules and the 2.0
release of PDELab.

This will be the last release with support for GCC 4.4 and older, future releases will
at least require GCC 4.5.
