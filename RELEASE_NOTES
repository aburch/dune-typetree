the 2.4-dev series of PDELab.

Changes
=======

TypeTree 2.4
------------

- TypeTree has updated its minimum compiler requirements. You now need a compiler that is at
  least compatible with GCC 4.5 in C++11 mode.


TypeTree 2.3
------------

This release only contains minor changes to fix buildsystem issues and fix a number of
bugs.

- Full support for CMake (thanks to Christoph and Markus!).

- Fixes to Autotools tests.

- Resolved some compilation problems on older compilers.

- Release history

  TypeTree 2.3.1
  - Release without further changes

  TypeTree 2.3.1-rc1
  - Small fixes to included headers and documentation

  TypeTree 2.3.0
  - Skipped because version 2.3.1 of the core modules was released in the meantime
    and it was considered better to keep the version numbers in sync



TypeTree 1.0
------------

This is the initial standalone release. It only contains changes due to the extraction
from the PDELab sources.

- Moved headers from dune/pdelab/common/typetree/ to dune/typetree/.

- Changed namespace from Dune::PDELab::TypeTree to Dune::TypeTree.

- Moved tests to top-level directory tests/.
