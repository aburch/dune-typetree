TypeTree
========

This is the 1.0 release of the TypeTree library for statically typed object trees.

TypeTree 1.0 simply represents the state of the library when it was extracted from
PDELab, only adjusted for the namespace change resulting from the move to a freestanding
library.

Future development will most likely drop support for some of the older compiler still
supported by this release.


Changes
=======

TypeTree 1.0
------------

This is the initial standalone release. It only contains changes due to the extraction
from the PDELab sources.

- Moved headers from dune/pdelab/common/typetree/ to dune/typetree/.

- Changed namespace from Dune::PDELab::TypeTree to Dune::TypeTree.

- Moved tests to top-level directory tests/.
